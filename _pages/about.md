Hi! My name is Jess Moorefield, and I am a CS master's student at Florida State University. My main research interests are natural language interfaces for relational databases, Text-to-SQL parsing, and data privacy solutions for LLMs. Currently, I'm working on a project for . I started this project two-and-a-half years ago, first developing it as my undergraduate honors thesis and working all the way through my master's thesis, which I expect to finish this coming spring. I hope to expand upon a similar topic in a PhD program starting fall 2024. 

I have an interdisciplinary background in both English and computer science, particularly for technical communication for a non-technical audience. Along the same line, what drew me to my research interests was their practical, real-world benefits for non-technical end users. 

I've also been an active member of FSU's research community since my sophmore year of undergraduate. I've worked for different organizations to contribute original scholarly research in computer science, as well as to facilitate undergraduate research participation. I was an instructor for FSU's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) for two years, which provides first- and second-year undergraduates with year-long research assistanceships across FSU. I participated in this program myself during my sophomore year, which inspired me to pursue research for the rest of my education, and I'm passionate about extending the same welcome into the research community that I received. 

Please feel free to check out my CV and list of publications and projects, and thanks for stopping by!
