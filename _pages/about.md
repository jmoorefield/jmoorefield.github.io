Hi! My name is Jess Moorefield, and I am a CS master's student at Florida State University. My main research interests are natural language interfaces for relational databases and Text-to-SQL tasks. I've worked on a project for the past two-and-a-half years, starting with my undergraduate honors thesis and working all the way through my master's thesis, which I expect to finish this coming spring. I hope to expand upon this line of work in a PhD program. ** Add more about interdisciplinary work/practical applications **

I've been an active member of FSU's research computer science my sophmore year of undergraduate, working for multiple organizations to contribute original scholarly research as well as to facilitate undergraduate research participation. ** Add about teaching UROP **
