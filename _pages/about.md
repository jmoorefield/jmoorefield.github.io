Hi! My name is Jess Moorefield, and I am a CS PhD student at North Carolina State University. My research interest is in human-computer interaction for data engineers. My previous research was in Text-to-SQL machine learning models. I have 4 years of research experience, and my latest work was my master's project, which investigated entity resolution through SQL views in Text-to-SQL models.

I have an interdisciplinary background in both English and computer science, particularly for technical communication for a non-technical audience. Along the same line, what drew me to my research interests was their practical, real-world benefits for non-technical end users.

This is my first year at NC State. I did my bachelor's and master's in Computer Science and bachelor's in Editing, Writing, and Media at Florida State University (FSU). While at FSU, I was an active member of the research community. I worked for different organizations to contribute original scholarly research in computer science, as well as to facilitate undergraduate research participation. I also served as a graduate teaching assistant for undergraduate software engineering courses. 

Please feel free to check out my research, CV, and course projects. Thanks for stopping by!
