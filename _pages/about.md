Hi! My name is Jess Moorefield, and I am a CS master's student at Florida State University. My research interest is in Text-to-SQL models and their practical application, including data privacy solutions and studying non-technical users' interactions with the model. Currently, I'm working on a project investigating entity resolution through SQL views in Text-to-SQL models. I started this project two-and-a-half years ago, first developing it as my undergraduate thesis and now fullfilling the requirements for my master's degree. I will defend my master's thesis in spring 2024, and I hope to expand upon a similar line of research in a PhD program starting fall 2024. 

I have an interdisciplinary background in both English and computer science, particularly for technical communication for a non-technical audience. Along the same line, what drew me to my research interest was its practical, real-world benefits for non-technical end users. 

I've also been an active member of FSU's research community since my sophmore year of undergraduate. I've worked for different organizations to contribute original scholarly research in computer science, as well as to facilitate undergraduate research participation. I was a leader for FSU's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP) for two years, which provides first- and second-year undergraduates with two-semester research assistanceships across FSU. I participated in this program myself during my sophomore year. It inspired me to pursue research for the rest of my education, and I'm passionate about extending the same welcome into the research community to other students that I received. 

Please feel free to check out my paper explaining the current stage of my research, my undergraduate thesis, and 
my CV and course projects. Thanks for stopping by!
